Applicable Law/Dispute Procedures.</span> Use of this Site and these Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of Wyoming, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any dispute concerning your use of this Site shall be submitted to binding arbitration in Wyoming within one (1) year from the date that the cause of action arose (or, if multiple causes of action are involved, from the date that the first cause of action arose), with such arbitration conducted pursuant to the then prevailing rules of the American Arbitration Association. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no arbitration brought pursuant to these Terms and Conditions shall be joined to any other arbitration initiated pursuant to these Terms and Conditions.<br><br>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in these Terms and Conditions, Yoga Today may at any time seek injunctive or other appropriate relief against you and/or against others, in any state or federal court in the state of Wyoming, in the event that Yoga Today believes that you have violated or threatened to violate any of Yoga Today's intellectual property rights and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts.<br><br>In the event that any portion of these Terms and Conditions are deemed unenforceable, unlawful or void by a court of competent jurisdiction, in any jurisdiction for any reason because of the scope, duration or area of its applicability or for other reasons, unless narrowed by construction, such provision shall for purposes of such jurisdiction only, be construed as if such invalid, prohibited or unenforceable provision had been more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable (or if such language cannot be drawn narrowly enough, the court making any such determination shall have the power to modify, to the extent necessary to make such provision or provisions enforceable in such jurisdiction, such scope, duration or area or all of them, and such provision shall then be applicable in such modified form). If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such provision would be held to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction for any reason, such provision, as to such jurisdiction only, shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, prohibition or unenforceability, without invalidating the remaining provisions. No narrowed construction, court-modification or invalidation of any provision shall affect the construction, validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. No waiver by Yoga Today of any term or condition of these Terms and Conditions shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or of any other term, and Yoga Today's failure to assert any right or demand compliance with any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any such right or provision.<br><br>Copyright 2008-9 Yoga Today LLC.
