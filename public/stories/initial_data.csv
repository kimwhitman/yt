A friend recently told me about your program and I have tuned in religiously ever since. I enjoyed yoga classes at my gym until I delivered my daughter and they recently changed their policy regarding childcare. Therefore I'm not able to go there anymore. If it wasn't for your show, I wouldn't be able to keep up with my practice which I immensely enjoy everyday. So thank you so much for helping me ""breathe"" everyday.

Jan,,Gig Harbor,WA,USA,flyfishun@comcast.net,12/4/2006,Asanas,"Hi Kim, Adi, Neesha and Sarah!!  

Just wanted to say you are a Godsend for my yoga practice.  I have been trying to find a way to do my yoga without the repetition of a CD.  My muscles have gotten more toned and my spirituality is improving.  I just love your classes!  I am not very flexible but am working on it with you to help.  

I feel a kinship with you practicing in Wyoming as I was born in raised in Worland.  I currently live in Gig Harbor Washington and love it here.  Seattle has all the yoga classes and driving 40 miles or more just doesn't fit in the picture for me.  

I am a 45 year old nurse who was working the night shift and am now working during the day in the ER.  I have told lots of people about your site and they are as excited as I am.  Please don't change anything!!!  If I can't do a pose, I'll work on it and it gives me a goal to reach!!!

You and your company have successfully obtained a meaningful and healthy lifestyle on the web that everyone can enjoy!!!  I downloaded one of Neesha's classes on my ipod and practiced my yoga in the San Juan Islands just north of here.  I could have probably done it on my own but why when I have you guys!!!

Thanks again for your yoga and spirituality that you bring!

Namaste

Brenda,,Mandeville,La,USA,iam4jesus@bellsouth.net,12/5/2006,"To Adi, Neesha and Sarah… two words…THANK YOU!","Many years ago, I began practicing yoga under a terrific teacher. After about 10 years she moved and I never could find another teacher who could bring true satisfaction to my practice. I attended other teachers’ classes, bought TONS of CD’s and read all the books in an attempt to rekindle my yoga-fire. I loved it so much; it’s hard to believe that I allowed it to slip from me but 8 years (and 20 lbs.) later I could hardly touch my toes.

A month or so ago, my SWEET husband ran across your daily pod cast and asked me to try it. He set up a computer in our bedroom (my personal yoga studio) and connected it to the t.v. so I could see you better. Of course at first I was unbelievably tight but my muscles soon began to loosen (and still do) and my thrill of yoga came back!

To Neesha: Your sweet spirit flows right through my t.v. screen. And YES! Life IS wonderful. Thank you for reminding us at every opportunity of life’s wonders. Also, you are incredibly strong for such a tiny girl.

To Sarah: Okay! After the class where you had us doing all those squats, I could hardly walk for 3 days but THANK YOU for waking up my legs!

To Adi: I love the way your movements flow and you work me so …hard! I love it! I haven’t done a backbend in years!!! I’ve decided to make that one of my goals.

I remember people coming into our class for the first time and LAUGHING with nervousness at our poses saying, “RIGHT! I don’t THINK so!” We would always say that at one time we were all beginners and that’s why they called it PRACTICING! No one was perfect. Now….I tell myself that same thing—daily.

I can only say thank you again for helping me find my NAMASTE again!",25.jpg
Patrice,,Bronx,NY,U.S.A.,halpatrice@aol.com,12/10/2006,Results After Five Months of Yoga Today!,"I first started yoga 6 months ago with a beginner's dvd.  After a month, I looked for something more challenging, I searched the web and I found ""Yoga Today"".  What a godsend!!  

At first, I found all of the poses challenging, especially the downward facing dog.  My arms would tremble and my legs would shake.  I would end the class sweating and exhausted, but I resolved to stay with it.  

Well after 5 months and countless sun salutations later, I can find ""ease amongst my efforts"" as Adi would say.  My family and friends notice my weight loss, and I tell them about my yoga practice.  My muscles are not as stiff as they used to be and I am doing downward facing dog as my rest pose in my vinyasa practice.  My arms and legs are more toned and I have more flexibility than I ever did.  

I look forward to every class and I am working on doing this 7 days a week instead of just 5 or 6.

Thank you Adi, Neesha and Sarah for your guidance and inspirational classes!!!",
Malinda,,Rutherford,NJ,,Malinda_Kopec@yahoo.com,12/11/2006,the greatest thing I've ever discovered on the internet!!,"Namaste! I'm just writing to thank you all for the greatest thing I've ever discovered on the internet!! You guys rock! It's like taking a class every day at my convenience. I feel like I am in the room with everyone and it's a group experience. Some constructive feedback ; ) I was looking at the future schedule and see that it says we are doing the 5th chakra and then the 4th. We just finished the second so I hope that the schedule is incorrect and we'll be doing the 3rd and then the 4th chakra ; ) Also, you guys always mention that we can email any questions but I don't see that option on this otherwise wonderful site! One last thing ; ) sometimes the camera person isn't showing the person who is doing the full extention of the pose. I know we should see the modifications also but most of us are probably aware of the modification or if we are staying at one stage are comfortable without having to glance at the screen. But if I want to go into the deepest expression of the pose I'd like to see it. Especially the other day when one of the guest students was a yogini who had practiced with Patabbi Jois. I could NOT do that fullest extension but would have LOVED to have seen her in it, I'm sure it was beautiful!

Anyway, constructive feedback aside, what you are offering is a beautiful thing, you have brought a lot of the joy of Yoga back to my life. I have been practicing for about 15 years and as I'm sure you know our practice ebbs and flows as does life, I feel like the tide is coming in right now, thank you all for this!

Namaste and Shanti, Malinda

P.S. Love how you begin class in a relaxing way, would love to do a few OM's ; )",

Andi,,Edinburgh,,Scotland,andistaheli@hotmail.com,12/15/2006,Yoga Everyday in Edinburgh,"We just moved to Scotland at the end of September.  I quickly found that the gyms and yoga centers here are very expensive, and kind of far away by bus or on foot. I only had a yoga DVD (because it didn't require extra equipment to pack)that only worked on my husband's laptop--which he took with him every day. I was feeling really trapped in my own body and needed to recover. The Edinburgh views are beautiful, but the thought of running in the cold, wind, and/or rain, has never appealed to me. One day I found a large yoga book,but needed to be walked through it.  I then went to the internet to see if I could find a podcast. Yoga Today worked that first day, and I've never felt the need to try any other podcasts.

I have always been an intense aerobic, spinning, weight training type person. I thrived on the challenge, however I've never had a ""perfect figure."" 
 
Right before my husband and I moved to Scotland I was recovering from my second miscarriage this year.  I began searching for a way to ""heal"" my body, mind and spirit.
I had no idea that yoga healed everything.  I mean everything, everything!  It was a virtual answer to my prayers, and continues to be.  

I have just learned that my life long prescription may have been a factor in my miscarriages.  I have a hernia and severe acid reflux without it. It's been difficult to ween myself off of it, but! there's yoga for yucky tummies too.

My husband listens to the classes when he's got a day off, and has become a major supporter of my yoga practice.  Thank you for training me to love my divine body, to nurture and heal it.  Thank you for helping me to work on untangling the stubborn knots in my back. (I honestly thought the knot under my left clavicle would be a life sentence!)

Since there are new episodes for every day, I never want to miss one! Yoga will be forever a part of my life.  It has only been a couple of months, but what an impact it has made.

I had tried many things to stregthen the back and make the pain subside.  Nothing worked very well.  I had to change careers and got into real estate.  I met a guy in the office that turned me onto yoga.  I had only been practicing (blindly might I add) for a few weeks when I found Yoga Today.  I am certainly glad I did.  Although I can't do all the practices, I enjoy doing what I can.  I am new at this and already feel so much better.  I sleep better, I am able to move more freely, and I don't have the constant pain that I use to.  Sometimes I will feel some pain in my back when I first awake, but after a little yoga and breathing I feel so much better and ready to face the day.  I know that there will be a day when the pain will be gone and never return. I just wanted to say ""Thank You so much"".  You are angels and are making a difference.",

Janet,,Leo,IN,,rgoodyear@prodigy.net,12/27/2006,I look forward to having a daily means of practice,"I've always been ""the athletic type"" and yoga has been a favorite form of working with the physical body for over 30 years.

In 2000, my interest in developing the mental & spiritual bodies peaked with a visit to an ashram in India. I took a yoga class which required holding the asanas for long periods of time.  I entered a transcendental state.  It wasn't a quiet, meditative state, I was breathing differently.  My tongue was out of my mouth, like a dog panting. I knew that meridians had opened via the yoga postures but I didn't know how to direct or manage all this energy. I wanted to guide it up through the chakras & through the crown but it was pretty overwhelming. I shifted to several different positions trying to find the one I could maintain as long as was necessary. Finally, I asuumed a pose with my pelvis pressed hard against the earth & directed the energy into the ground.

From that day on, I decided to train with yoga as seriously as I had trained to earn my masters degree in education of seriously emotionally disturbed children. 

I'm currently looking for a teacher or traing center to earn certification.  In the meantime, I've happened upon 
the Yoga today website. I look forward to having a daily means of practice with Yogatoday.com",

Shannon,,Chicago,IL,,shannon_marie66@hotmail.com,1/1/2007,"If it wasn't for Yoga Today, I would have had to shelve my yoga ambitions","I took my very first yoga class six months ago, and it was an instant fit. Yoga just makes sense to me -- both physically and mentally. Then, about four months ago, I started a new job which was full of stress and kept me in the office so late that I couldn't make my yoga class. If it wasn't for Yoga Today, I would have had to shelve my yoga ambitions -- at least for the time being.

I was a little concerned that doing a class -- even daily -- at home alone wasn't challenging enough for me, and that I was missing something, so I recently took my mat back to a weekend class. The result: It was TOO EASY! I couldn't wait to get back home and get down and dirty on my mat with a Yoga Today class.

My cat (see the picture) is also a fan of me doing yoga at home.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CREATING THIS WEBSITE!!  I found yogatoday through a Self magazine add (I think) and I absolutely love it!  The class variety is so great, it is so much better than any classes I have taken in the past!  Since it is a new class each day, I don't want to miss a single one, so it encourages me to log on each and every day.

I have always wanted to practice yoga in the morning before work, but it is hard to find classes that early, that coincide with my work schedule.  The only thing that is better than yoga is yoga in the morning - it really starts out my day in the best possible way!  

Another added benefit to finding YogaToday - I have lost almost 20 lbs (13% of my weight)in the past year due to ONLY yoga practice, and since I have found YogaToday and have been able to work out every day, I have really firmed up and friends and family ask what I have done, no one can believe it is ONLY yoga!  My body would never respond to any other activity like this!!

The location in the fall with the backdrop of the mountains, or a running stream was so perfect.  I thought I would really miss that in the winter, but with the television screen showing the scenic scenes, it is just as great!  Great thinking!!

Thanks Adi, Neesha, & Sarah for your dedication and sincerity to helping everyone discover this wonderful practice!  It brings me such calmness and is such a stress releiver, I really beleive that yoga cures everything!  Ladies - keep us the great work!",

This is a wonderful idea – and I don't think the combination of instructors could be any better.  The various yoga styles complement each other so well – especially the anusara and ashtanga…   Recently being introduced to anusara yoga by a new teacher has really helped me to learn to keep my heart open when my tendencies are to 'bear down' – collapsing my shoulders and chest – in demanding poses…

I would love to see you occasionally invite an older person to join the practice on screen a specifically address the ways to address the aging process through yoga.  I would also love it if you would do a practice that is really gentle with a soft flow element that I could copy and do when I am not up to a more strenuous practice.   Perhaps you have already done a gentle flow practice in the past and I missed it, if so, perhaps you could repeat it if a practice like this is already in your archives.

My usual stretching was clearly inadequate and my sister suggested integrating yoga into my life to bring greater flexibility, strength and balance to my running. I found Yoga Today and was struck by how a daily yoga practice not only improved how my body felt, but brought a greater sense of peace and well-being, and a greater appreciation of ""being present"" in the moment.

I have been off and on practicing yoga for about 8-10 years (wow...I'm only 22...I just realized, that's a long time!)  Anywho.  Long story short, when the woman I took yoga from (who used to be my dance teacher) closed her studio and had a baby and got married and moved away, I haven't really done much yoga.  The only really good reason is that the only classes offered here at Ohio State don't really work out with my schedule.  I prefer to practice in the evening to slink into the latter part of my day, and since i've been in college, that part of day is always full.  

I was chatting with some friends, and one recommended yogatoday.com, so I immediately visited your website and began to download my first practices. I downloaded about a month ago, and I finally got around to doing the class last night.  Thank heavens! I took a shoulder opening class with Adi, and afterward, I called my boyfriend and we were talking about it, and i told him how much of a sense of clarity i have not only physically, but also in my mind and in my overall energy.  I don't know what it is, but after not practicing for over a year, I can tell the difference that yoga makes in my life.

I am *almost* drawn to tears because now I can not only maintain the peace of mind I gain from yoga, but I can also keep my body tuned up for dancing at my own convenience.  This is thanks to yogatoday.  Thank you for providing me with this opportunity (though you maybe weren't aware of it...)

Lisbeth,,San Antonio,TX,USA,fifthkyu@yahoo.com,1/21/2007,I suddenly have been able to take my yoga to a new level.,"To the staff at yogatoday.com,
I just wanted to say thank you for the high quality of both video and classes. I discovered yoga when I was 16 (1996) and have been practicing mostly on my own for the majority time, using books, videos, and yogajournal.com. I attended a yoga studio over four years ago for about four months before the studio closed. Gym Yoga classes were too big and I received no personal direction, though I did learn to have a lot more fun with my sequences. 

Finding YogaToday.com was a happy accident. It was mentioned in a magazine and I thought I would check it out. Since that day a few months ago, I've seen a big difference in my yoga practice. I suddenly have been able to take my yoga to a new level. My strength and flexibility have increased. I have learned to incorporate more poses into my yoga arsenal. I concentrate more on my alignment and breathing, and have even begun to write down some of the daily wisdom and sequences that truly hit home. I thank you again for the wonderful work. You have inspired me to continue pursuing my dream of one day teaching yoga. I hope to continue practicing via your website and look forward to learning from all of you. 

I am curious if yogatoday.com has any intentions of creating a DVD collection. I am eager to retain a great number of the asana sequences for future practice. 

Sincerely,
Liz",
Dave,,San Diego,CA,,ttca111@aol.com,1/22/2007,You three are taking non-greediness to a whole new level.,"Dearest Yoginis,
 
I am a yoga junkie and I think your website is TOPS. I can't believe you give an hour of great instructions everyday for FREE.  You three are taking non-greediness to a whole new level.  You three as teachers are extremely competent.  I have been to over 220 different teachers so I think I know good teachers.
 
Because I recently have been having lower back problems due to too many donuts and too many birthdays I really appreciated last week's lower back session.  Do you do any gentle/bliss yoga-svaroopa?  I only discovered you recently so you may have already done a session or two??  
 
The only problem I have with your wonderful program is I can't decide which one of you I want to hug first.  If I can't make up my mind I will just have to come to Jackson Hole and do some yoga with all three of you and hug all of you. 
 
Seriously, you have a great idea and I hope it works out for you.  Do you have a studio in Jackson Hole that you teach at?  I download your programs to my ipod.  Is there such a thing as bluetooth from your computer to your tv so I can watch you sessions on my bigger tv screen?  I am going to find the answer to this question and when I do I will tell you.  It would be another feature that will add to your terrific site.
 
Love to you all.
 
Dave 
 
Namaste

As a full-time university professor and part-time yoga instructor, there are days when my home practice results in 10 surya namaskara A & 10 surya namaskara B. My body wants to do more, but my brain is too tired to creatively link poses in any meaningful sequence, and I can't bear the thought of one of my many DVDs for which I've memorized all the practices. Enter Yoga Today. Now I can power up my computer, select a class that resonates with my mood, and bask in the delight of a new and great practice. I especially appreciate that the instructors are knowledgeable about anatomy in the context of yoga, providing solid verbal adjustments and giving variations and modifications for the poses - perfect for beginning and experienced yogis alike.

Jackie,,Ithaca,NY,USA,jackie@plyandburl.com,1/24/2007,the classes are doing wonders: I come away feeling calm and refreshed for hours,"As a beginning triathlete, I've spent the last year almost entirely focused on running, biking and swimming. With all those other sports taking up my time, my once-strong yoga practice fell to the wayside, and took with it much of my flexibility and strength. Recently, I decided to bring yoga back into my training regimen. In my search for a quality but inexpensive way to restart my practice, I ran across Yoga Today. I was skeptical, because most of the yoga videos and podcasts I've used have been too easy or too slow. But Yoga Today's classes go at a great pace and the instructors are clearly expert practitioners. Best of all, the classes are doing wonders: I'm more flexible again, my chest, back and core are stronger, and I come away each time feeling calm and refreshed for hours. Thanks so much for this wonderful service!",81.jpg
Amanda,,Shaker Heights,OH,United States,amanda.bruner@gmail.com,1/25/2007,Yoga Today has changed my life in simple and profound ways.,"There are so many things that I can write about in this testimonial to explain how many ways Yoga Today has changed my life and my yoga practice.  I will try and be brief and to the point.  

I have practiced yoga for about six years…so since I was about 20 years old.  I started in college, but did not really become serious until I was in graduate school.  I found a studio in Connecticut that was purely Ashtanga and fell in love… although it took me awhile to build the strength to simply sit cross-legged comfortably!  But as soon as I started to built strength and flexibility, I was hooked.  I was fortunate to have the time to go three times a week and I started my first home practices.  It was empowering.

When I moved back home to Cleveland, I did not find a studio that had a strong Ashtanga class.  Also, as a Kindergarten teacher, I did not have as much time to go to a studio.  When I found out about your site, I was so excited.  

To make a long story short, the first thing I do every morning is download the next class.  I look forward to the end of the days I am able to set up my mat and computer to complete a wonderful, full, intelligent, information-filled yoga practice from Adi, Neesha or Sarah.  I told my friends at work that I feel like I have three new friends and how sometimes I find myself laughing alone in my apartment at a funny moment during class.     

Yoga Today has changed my life in simple and profound ways.  Thank for your time, dedication and knowledge.  I look forward to many many more classes.

Erin,,COEUR D'ALENE,ID,USA,erin@theprovostfamily.com,1/26/2007,"Yoga Today has made a huge difference in my life, Thank You!!","Thank you so very much for Yoga Today! 

I am a stay-at-home mom with a 3 year old and a 2 year old and these classes mean more to me than I could possibly express. Being fortunate enough to be home with my kids is something I am constantly grateful for but it does come with consequences, some of those including not having the time or money to take a yoga class at a studio or gym. After years of the same 3 yoga videos and one book rotated over and over I had hit a huge wall in my practice and when I found Yoga Today it was such a huge door opened up for me. The instructors are amazing and the variety offered is perfect. 

I wish I had the words to tell you how truly grateful I am, Yoga Today has made a huge difference in my life, Thank You!! ",
May,,Reading,MA,USA,typeagirlpilot@aol.com,1/29/2007,Yoga Today is my new training secret!,"Thank you for bringing us fresh daily yoga practices free! While I have been doing yoga for 2.5 years now, I consider myself very new to many of aspects of yoga. 

Initially I started my yoga practice with the intent to get deeper stretching into my athletic routine as a triathlete; merely to quiet down all-over nagging from a tight lower back, hips, hamstrings, and knee soreness.

My flexibility training from yoga has served me well as I trained for my big 2006 race - an Ironman triathlon - a body gets stiff over the months it takes to train for a race consisting of a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike, and a full marathon at the end! After completing this race in November 2006, I entered my off-season with a focus on flexibility and strength training as opposed to endurance. I wanted a more comprehensive yoga practice outside of my once favorite yoga DVDs labeled ""for athletes"". (I always thought that including ""..For Athletes.."" was such an ignorant title inclusion for a DVD practice because I do believe that much of yoga is athletically challenging in itself - mentally and physically.)

In my search for new and more challenging yoga options as my off-season training began, I was absolutely pleased to find Yoga Today. All the instructors at Yoga Today impart such deep knowledge to the audience as each session takes place without taking away from the practice. As I mentioned earlier, I still consider myself new to the world of yoga, and I appreciate how the instructors offer modification options for the poses if they are beginner or more advanced.

With each session on Yoga Today I am learning to become more in tune and aware of my body, more centered in my being and ""in the moment"", and I am fulfilled with my background knowledge of yoga.

With each instructor's dedication to bringing the public quality yoga instruction, it is quite enjoyable for me to immerse myself in my yoga practice. Yoga Today has turned my yoga practice from something I used to view as ""preventative maintenance"" on my body into something I wholly look forward to doing. It has turned ""doing yoga"" into ""practicing yoga"" for me. Furthermore, not only is it helping my body cope with the training demands that I will be imposing on it as I begin a new training cycle for my next big race in July, but it is teaching me how to connect my mind with my body more.

Yoga Today is my new training secret in helping me achieve my other athletic endeavors! Maybe in my next finishing line photo, I'll do a flying Hanumasana right across the finish line!

I have shared this website with all of my fellow yogis and sincerely want to thank you for all that you have given me!  

As a 47 year old mother of three, I've always exercised in some way and kept myself in pretty good shape, but this has taken my exercise routine to a whole new level! I have sufferred panic attacks and depression for years and by employing the breathing and relaxation techniques, I have been able to squelch many a panic attack.  I think that the feeling of confidence that I hold in my heart and mind after each class has truly lifted my depression as well!

I had discovered yoga while studying in New Zealand, and to much of my dismise, when I came back home, the only yoga class that was being taught was one always packed, and second extremely slow and not corresponding to my past experience. Nevertheless,the lack of any yoga studio triggered my own personal practice. I attended workshops abroad and bought books to work on my own. I now live in Italy, and even though I found a fantastic teacher here, I like to keep practicing on my own very much, developing ""my"" yoga, and Yoga today is seconding me, enriching my practice, plus helping me find new interesting combinations, which after having thoroughly tested and practiced I can thus transmit to my own students (yes I started teaching yoga!!!)

Shannon,,Chicago,IL,USA,shannon_marie66@hotmail.com,2/6/2007,My cat is also a fan of me doing yoga at home!,"I took my very first yoga class six months ago, and it was an instant fit. Yoga just makes sense to me -- both physically and mentally. Then, about four months ago, I started a new job which was full of stress and kept me in the office so late that I couldn't make my yoga class. If it wasn't for Yoga Today, I would have had to shelve my yoga ambitions -- at least for the time being.

I was a little concerned that doing a class -- even daily -- at home alone wasn't challenging enough for me, and that I was missing something, so I recently took my mat back to a weekend class. The result: It was TOO EASY! I couldn't wait to get back home and get down and dirty on my mat with a Yoga Today class.

My cat (see the picture) is also a fan of me doing yoga at home.

Jady,,La Jolla,CA,United States,jadydmont@earthlink.net,2/10/2007,truely changing my life for the better in all ways,"Thank you is so inadequate!  After a few months, YogaToday has become a part of our household most mornings and I am enjoying it more each week. I am 56 years old and renewed a regular  yoga practice a year ago for the first time in many years at a very fine local studio. It was a great thing to get me going but I was still unable to go there as much as I might have liked, tiime and cost being a consideration. And, though I'm pretty good at taking instruction home, it is never the same and I missed the company. YogaToday took care of those obstacles.  (No excuses now :-).  It is truely changing my life for the better in all ways. For those of us crossing over the middle years I think it is the best health and prevention program available. My husband (who is 64 ) is new to yoga and I had been passing on what I know and had put together a simple routine with an instructor for us.  He didn't want to go to the studio and I was concerned that I wasn't introducing him properly - and couldn't get him to understand certain basics, beginning with the breath.  Getting it from your wonderful instructors has changed that and he and I are both improving daily at our respective levels. Better all around :-)  He does what he can and inegrates new things with his regular routine. For example, he pulled his back twice in recent months and we couldn't figure out why.  Neesha's class on forward bend basics explained it and fixed his back!  I had also missed the inclusion of the aspects of Yoga  that focus on the internal organs and glands which I had had when I was first introduced to yoga in the 70s and could't find anywere.  Sara Kline's kundalini classes are terrific!  Adi is wonderful as well.  I feel very lucky and blessed each day when I turn on my compter and practice with all of you. Thank you so much.

Zak,,Cambridge,,UK,acidmaestro@hotmail.co.uk,2/12/2007,Your Yogi's are wonderfully graceful and really inspirational.,"Hi,

I would just like to congratulate you fo bringing yoga into my life once again.

I was imprisoned in Japan for 4 years for a crime I didn't commit and discovered yoga whilst there as a form of forgiveness and to help with the day-to-day stress of a dictatorial regime. However, the books I used became somewhat repetetive and boring and I stopped practicing prior to my return to the UK.

Since then I have looked at various DVD's but with the same results. Boredom after a few viewings. Now I've discovered Yoga Today with refreshing variations, which once again stimulate me and make me feel how I did when I first began practising.

Your Yogi's and Yogini's are wonderfully graceful and really inspirational.

Keep up the good work.

Jennifer,,Colorado Springs,CO,USA,thejenmartin@yahoo.com,2/16/2007,my favorite part of the day!,"I happened upon an ad for your website in Yoga magazine when I was at the salon one day. I thought, ""free, daily yoga classes? That's to good to be true."" I got home and logged onto the site expecting some sort of scam. What I found was a true blessing...

The past year I devleoped a severe disgestive disease that had caused my weight to plumet to a little less than 100lbs. I could not keep any nutrition in and would push myself to get through a work day, collapsing and the end of the day exhausted. Having been a dancer, runner, and yogi for over 20 years, this was disheartening.

Thanks to hypnotherapy, nutrition, and changes in lifestyle my weight is normal and I am able to eat again.

As I began to get well, I was very aware of how yoga would aid in my healing process. However, though I have an excellent yoga school down the street from me, paying $200 a month for daily classses was not feasible. I tried going once a week but I craved more.

Therefore, that day in the salon truly was life changing. Since I have found your website, I have practiced every day for three weeks. My weight has stablized even more, I have excellent muscle tone, and in today's class I went up in my first ever head stand!

Thank you so much for having this service. I am eternally grateful. I love your classes, the variety, and the knowledge. You are all amazing teachers and I will continue to look forward to all of your classes. (It is my favorite part of the day!)

many thanks for the great work you do every day!

Here is how I got to know your program: 

As a physiotherapist I have been in contact with many forms of sports and exercises, but for some reason never with yoga. 
Then I picked up a book in our local library that they were giving away, about yoga for older people. As I used to work in a geriatric hospital, that interested me and so I bought and read the book. I was absolutely fascinated!!! I wanted to learn more about yoga! So I borrowed another book and told everybody I knew about it. Unfortunately I am out of job at the moment and cannot afford to go to a yoga class. But then my brother-in-law, who owns a company producing business-podcasts, told me about your video-podcast. So I decided to check it out - and I am absolutely thrilled with it! I still hope to visit a yoga class as soon as I can afford it, but untill then I am so greatful for your program and even if I can go to a class, I am sure I will still continue to work with your program! 

My brother-in-law also suggested translating your program into German - I have told everybody I know about your wonderful podcast - but a lot of people here cannot understand the English instructions well enough to follow them. But I am afraid that recording a translation would need more time and money than I can afford at the moment. Have you ever thought about having your classes translated or do you maybe have a translation already?

I would love to hear from you and thank you again for providing me with a free yoga lesson every day!

I'm married with 3 children, 5, 7, and 9.  May, will be 1 year for us living in NJ back with family.  We raised our children in CA.  So that alone is bringing up lots of new feelings and I'm sure old ones as well.  Trying to continue being the person I became naturally in CA.  Now with the family influences and energy, I am challenged.

I've been doing yoga on and off for about 10 years, I'm 32.  Yoga opened my eyes to another world evolving spirit, and soul.  As I've been traveling my spiritual path.  Depression has been following me along.  I've dedicated myself to helping others.  I'm attending 2 holistic Schools and have a business.

My story is long but to get to the point, I have progressed and came a very long way.  I know what keeps me balanced.  Yoga or jump rope, kundalini meditation everyday.  If I get sick for more than a week and keeps me from my exercise down I go.  I don't completely understand why I have to work so hard to keep myself in balanced.  Then again I do understand, I am an overly sensitive person, I feel everything and everyone.  

My current obstacle is fear.  My meditation takes control over me unexpectedly at times.  Nausea and fear all over my body.  Now throughout the day I feel it all day, a little nausea mixed in with fear.  If I can release my fear.  I believe I can take that next step on my spiritual path.

Poses focusing on releasing fear would be a great class for myself and I'm sure for may others.  This is just a minor request, I understand you probably get many, many emails.  So this is just a humble request.  

Love you 3.

Stephanie,,Riverhead,NY,,szellner@optonline.net,3/4/2007,You all are angels.,"Prior to having my first child 4 months ago, I was addicted to yoga and the mind body connection that it captures in me.  However, I was only able to practice 1-2 times per week if I was lucky.  Because of that I never felt like I was getting any further in my practice.  Since having my baby, I was concerned that fitting yoga in would be even more difficult and consequently at this time in my life I need it even more. That's when I found you in my fitness magazine.  I am beyond thrilled with your instructors and classes and am now able to practice more than I ever was before.  My son Jackson even lays next to me as I practice.  I think it calms him as well.  I can't thank you enough for offering this to us.  You all are angels. ",

Needless to say, moving, being forced, in a way, to rest and understand myself better, was told about yoga today by a friend, and I began to practise yoga daily.  

I just cannot tell you how appreciative I am to this site.  You gave me the means to constantly move myself to alignment, to connect with myself fully so that I can have the capability within myself, to live my life fully.

As CEO of a multinational financial services company in Australia I work incredibly long hours and found it next to impossible to make the gym @ 6pm to do my much loved yoga classes. I often felt frustrated that I was wasting money on gym memberships and that I couldn't attend.

Now not only do I get to have a great class, but as a result my wife and I get to have a beautiful night together! 

First we put our son Leo to sleep @ 7pm, then put on the class in our TV room generally at 7:30 for one hour of total bliss! 

The great thing about it is that by the end of the class our hectic days are far away and both of us become much more relaxed. So by dinner and bed time our conversations and interactions are always filled with love, joy and happiness.

Yoga today has really added significant value to our lives so please accept my sincerest thank you and Namaste

I just wanted to thank you all for your hard work and for giving me a way to do yoga wherever I am. It takes away that extra effort to go out to a class and the best part (unlike a DVD)is that there are new themes every day. I just did the spring cleansing class last night and feel fantastic! I live in Nova Scotia and spend a lot of weekends at our weekend getaway, an old farmhouse in the country with no telephone, television or internet connection (which is just the way I want it).

I find at the end of my run that I could even go longer. I attribute it entirely to the yoga. I love the recent episode of yoga for cyclists and would love to see a yoga for runners. My kids also do a little yoga with me but they get bored of a full hour so I would love to see some shorter yoga sessions for kids.

Lina,,Copenhagen,,Denmark,lina_mlm@yahoo.com,4/4/2007,"With Yoga Today I still get that community feeling, which is hard to get when practising alone.","Having suffered from depression on and off since my teens, I have practiced yoga for about three years, but without the spiritual part. I only did it as an exercise, it felt good but with hindsight I can see that I didn't get all there is to get from yoga. When I was staying in California for a few months I met an amazing teacher and also read a book that inspired me to use yoga as an anti-depressive. I am now practising almost daily and I feel so much better. I have come off my medication and I feel better than I have done in years. It is no longer a chore but a joy to do yoga and I am always looking forward to the next time. And all this has been made possible by Yoga Today. I don't have the money or the time to go to a class every day but with Yoga Today I still get that community feeling, which is hard to get when you're practising all alone. So Yoga Today has profoundly changed my life for the better.

Women in my village are very modest and many of them choose to cover their entire faces.  I wanted to find some form of exercise, but I felt too self conscious being the only woman in the village out exercising on the unpaved rocky roads.  There is a gym in the village, but only men are permitted to use it.  

I was so thankful when I found your yoga class through podcasts.  I can now exercise peacefully in my own home!  You helped me find a way to still be myself in my Muslim community.  Being the only American in the village has been challenging and so many days, I have come home feeling lost, alone, and defeated.  Your yoga classes have helped me focus on the positive aspects of my life and my work and have helped me purge the stress that accumulates from being a foreigner in such a small and different place.

Casie,,Minneapolis,MN,U.S.A,herr0225@umn.edu,4/6/2007,Yoga Today gives me the same love I give to my classes,"I am not your average yoga teacher- I smoke a pack a day, work for abortion providers, and have blood red hair and a nose ring despite the health club where I work's policy of ""natural"" hair color and facial piercings. I still have the highest attendance of any classes there. That is why they won't fire me. I started out teaching yoga to girls on probation, and fell in love with sharing yoga. I have been teaching for 4 years now, and I have watched my students overcome many obstacles, it is awesome to see their progression. My biggest obstacle this year is my mom's death. She left behind my 3 sisters ages 13, 15, 17, and my meth-addicted brother, 23. I am 27 going on 100. I have always been obsessed with death, but now even more so. I don't know what I would do without yoga. It keeps me sane despite this spinning world... One particularly horrible day I turned on Yoga Today and checked out my fave teacher Neesha and the class made me laugh, they always seem so perfect and relevant- it was entitled ""Overcoming Obstacles By Changing Your Attitude"" Here I am imagining the whole world is opposing me when all I need to do is change my attitude- Change the way I percieve my opposition. I used to be so innocent, believing anything was possible through sheer effort, but it is true! It is like Shiva lifting Mt. Kailasa with his finger.

This is my story:  Since I had my child, Nicolas now in the age of three , I did not have the time to go to any fitness center as i was used to go to before my pregnancy before I did do various activities such as  body building, modern dance, classic dance and many other sports as skiing and tennis which really made me feel good ..after my child was born I did not have anymore time for myself and being a single working mother I to had to face very difficulties not only emotional as I the relation with my partner dif finish but also in my job as in well as housekeeping all completely by myself. I did from day to day get more and more exhausted and stressed.   I was to empty that i started to have panic attacks and did not even like to go outside to meet friends as I always did in the past. After I had reached my bottom end and lost all my energy  I had found in my home library a yoga book which my mother had been given by a  yoga teacher several years ago when she was younger and used to work in Switzerland. I did read this book with attention  and descovered the healing power of Yoga. I started to practice the asanas everyday as indicated in the book and realy I began to feel better day after day. I then did get fond of yoga and wanted to learn more about it , but in the town where I'm leaving there is no yoga good school .. I then did get to know  about  your programme in the yogayournal and since then I'm trying to do my best to follow all your lessons every day, and it's really a big experience and fun .

Erika,,Madison,WI,,erika@luhala.com,4/12/2007,Yoga makes for happier mothering.,"I wrote my story as a review of the yoga today site for my zine.  Namaste!

Yoga makes for happier mothering.

I started practicing yoga during my second pregnancy.   Yoga emphasizes being in the present moment, relaxing in your body, and provides space for awareness and reflection.  Yoga was great for maintaining my fitness during the pregnancy, and helped me relax through the birth, but the most awesome part of all is that the practice helps me every day in my parenting. 

Who knew that besides making my body feel so darn good, yoga would make me a better mom?  

When I focus on my physical work of maintaining a difficult asana (Yoga pose), I need to fully concentrate my mind on what is happening in that moment.  Every day, I use that same purposeful concentration to stay in the moment with my kids.  Lets face it, usually I’m a bit frazzled, about to forget something important, and feeling totally distracted.  When I feel like that, I have an urge to space out when my kids are talking to me, or showing me something.  For me, it is so important not to do that. Even though I may have a long list of stuff I need to take care of, in each moment I have only that one opportunity to be fully present for my child.  They glow when they have my attention!  

A lot of times, I feel like those cartoon pictures of angry bulls with red faces and steam coming out of their ears.  The crying, whining and chaos of 3 kids sometimes is too much to take.  It gets pretty crazy, but before I lose it (And sometimes during that process- oy!), I stop and breathe the ujai breath, the deep, powerful victorious breath of yoga, and release some of my tension before I prioritize and deal with the circus.  The breath calms and relaxes and can stop a Mama Meltdown, which is a goooood thing.  Phew.

I’m selfish!  Awareness and reflection are a gift I give to myself during the 15 minutes, half hour, or (When I hit the trifecta of 3 sleeping kids), the hour that I get to practice yoga.  I find that I need to consciously attend to myself, with an explicit intention of doing so, or else my needs get put on the back burner while I take care of everyone else.  It is important to parent ourselves too, and yoga provides a means to care for the physical as well as the emotional.  

I have a hard time getting child care to go out to a class in a studio.  It is a wonderful luxury that I blissfully indulge in whenever I can, but the rest of the time, I enjoy a daily practice with free, down-loadable, instructor-led practices from www.yogatoday.com.  I think the site and what they are doing with it is really cool, and wanted to share the goodness.  

The creators of Yoga Today made their site to increase accessibility of yoga to everyone.  With that purpose, practices are available for download daily from their web page at no charge.  It is like having a new class every day of the year.  The practice is set up for all skill levels, but it doesn’t suffer from the too-easiness that many yoga DVDs have. The instructors give alternative poses when the practice goes into a difficult series (And some of them definitely are twisty) so beginners can benefit, and take time walking through proper positioning in the poses.  Another cool thing about the practices is that many of them have a spiritual type of theme to contemplate and work with as you do the poses. 

Classes can be watched directly from the website, or downloaded onto computers or ipods to save for later.  All you need is a mat and you’re set!

Namaste, Erika

Cecily,,Manchester,CT,,gothbunny@mac.com,4/13/2007,Thank you for reaching out to lone practiioners like myself,"Starting sometime in 2000, while living in a new city, I began to experience tremendous pelvic pain.  This pain, unidentified, continued to debilitate my life for the next seven years despite massage, surgery, poking, prodding, and chiropractic treatments.  

After moving to a new state, and finding new doctors, soon, my new therapist discovered the misalignement of my pelvis and urged me to go back to yoga as a way to strengthen the muscles around the pelvis and keep it in the proper alignement.  I had practiced yoga as a teenager, many, many years ago but was unable at the time to join the local Yoga studio.  I found some old yoga tapes, but slowly found myself, my body neededing to move further, go farther, strengthen more. 

I found Yoga Today, one afternoon, to my utter delight!  New practices (and an HOUR long too!) everyday that challenge and continue to keep me on a path to greater health and mental focus.  Yoga Today has been in my morning routine since then and my pelvic pain is minimal so long as I keep yoga in that routine.

Not only has my body become stronger and my pain dissolved, but the mental clarity and unwavering focus have become part of my life.  My coworkers recently mentioned how much calmer and focused I seemed to be, even in the midst of overtwhelming difficulties at work.  And it is true.

The next day I tried another, and now I've downloaded 8 classes, went out and bought a yoga mat, and try to practice every day or other day. In other words, your site has allowed me to now truly enjoy yoga! I'm sure my poses need more work, but now I enjoy the practice and look forward to trying the occasional group classes once again in the near future just to make sure an instructor can give me some corrections in my form.

About 4 months ago I came across an add for Yoga Today in a magazine and was absolutely delighted to find out that it was what it was advertised to be.  I can enjoy the benefits of a diverse yoga class and I do it once my children are in bed.  I look forward to 9:30pm every evening and practice with such gratitude for having this opportunity.  I love each of the instructors for their individual strengths and their unique perspective.

I'm a 27 year-old man returning to school for a degree in nursing.  Last semester, I tipped my balance by giving myself over completely to studying because I think somewhere inside of me I believe I must get A in all my classes.  Well, I got A's along with heart palpitations, insomnia and panic attacks.
I didn't find Yoga Today until right before this semester began.  I was truly scared that I would go through another semester of high anxiety and even contemplated giving up school if it became overwhelming.

I've been practicing with Yoga Today for the last three weeks and everyday I'm reminded to let go, life isn't perfect and I don't have to be perfect.  All I have to be is present and committed to making a really good effort but going only as much as I can for each moment.

I'm now taking care of myself so that I can truly be present when I take care of someone else.

Andy,,Quebec,,Canada,andy.van-drom.1@ulaval.ca,5/6/2007,I love the modifications that allow beginners as well as advanced students to participate.,"Dear Adi, Neesha & Sarah,

As a PhD student here at Laval University, I like to balance mental and physical efforts (""Mens sana in corpore sano"" has come a long way since the Roman Empire!).  Up until summer 2006, I did this by sweating a  few hours in the gym every week with friends.  I like to push my limits in whatever I do, and at one point I did this a little to much, straining my lower back in the process.  

As a result, I gave up the gym and took up three weekly yoga classes at the university sports centre. I am still amazed at how yoga provides me not only with a great physical workout, but also helps me to respect the limits of my body, which in turn has given me greater balance and focus.

I discovered Yoga Today a few months ago and I have been tuning in regularly since. I love the diversity of your classes and teaching styles, as well as the modifications that allow beginners as well as advanced students to participate.  Yoga Today definitely helps me to feel more confident in my practice as well, as it leaves more freedom for personal input as opposed to a group class where as a beginner you tend to do just that - follow the group.

I am greatly enjoying the ""best of"" episodes and I can't wait to practise outdoors in the garden myself!  For the moment, it still snows up here as you can see, but Yoga Today definitely brings me some sunshine every morning!

Thank You very much for this wonderful initiative!

Part of my extra weight was, well, um, a sympathetic pregnancy. My wife and I have had a kid. She's wonderful, but she doesn't leave us much time to get the exercise we used to. Yoga Today really helps with that. I do yoga when everyone else has gone to bed. 

I'm especially fond of Adi's shows. She puts her shows at the right level for me--not too easy, but not impossible. She also seems quite sweet and skilled. I honestly look forward to her classes.

I would be very glad if sometime she would direct a show to the martial artists in the audience. Alas, not all of us can live in lovely Jackson Hole. I like it when she does shows for the bikers, runners, and skiers, but I'm none of the above. I'm a judoka--I do judo. Yoga is a great corrective to my beat-up back, shoulders, and legs. If she's sometime short of ideas, judo is a lot like wrestling. I'm very sure he can take it from there.

Thanks a lot for all of your great work. I'm really grateful for it.

And when I went to spain (normally I'm studying in Berlin, Germany) to pass one year of my studies in Madrid, I was looking for sports to stay fit. 

As I found Yoga Today on the web, I first was sceptical but then decided just to try - I had nothing to loose! 

And I won everything - body-awareness, a conscious form to treat myself and to listen to what my body tells me, to find out where my limits are - far away from competition and stress. I discoverd that sport is not only something to stay fit/beautyful but also to free my mind in situations of stress, and instead of using my body for wrong ambition I learned to honour it, as it is.

Then I realized that I am not as flexible as I would like to be, so I bought a Yoga video and started alternating Yoga and running. And that is pretty much how I fell in love with Yoga. 

I recently moved back to Ramallah, Palestine (West Bank) and started working as a research scientist, my schedule has turned from crazy to absolutely ridiculous and I have not been able to run, then i discovered Yoga Today, and for the last two weeks I have taken up Yoga again, and this time more seriously than before, because this time Yoga is my primary form of excersice when I get a chance I still like to run/jog, but I find Yoga far more interesting and challenging. 

I love Yoga Today, because it is right there on my computer, I just turn it on and voila I am in class. The Yoga studio in the city is practically booked at least six months in advance, and I love that I have my own class in the mornings all to myself.

I never intend to buy another.  I love the instruction.  It seems so individualized.  Are you sure you can't see me when my back is slouching or my shoulders are lifted?

I have been practicing yoga for about five years, since I was in my late twenties.

At first I was skeptical that yoga could help reduce my constant knee and lower back pain.  Thank goodness I was open to change, my persistent knee & back discomfort has been tremendously reduced.  

I am a bodybuilder and my body gets stiff all over. Since I have done yoga, the tension has gone away.  Most of the guys at the gym are reluctant to practice viewing yoga is a ""light workout"". 
However, after a few of the guys joined in, they quickly realized that yoga is physically and mentally challenging and rewarding.  Any preconceived notions about ashtanga and power yoga being a light workout by fellow former college football players were quickly dismissed. 

I enjoy visiting Yoga Today to be inspired to learn more from Adi, Neesha, and Sarah

I'm generally an active, health-conscious person, and when I first moved here, I joined the local gym. But I found the constant, pounding, Euro-disco music (among a few other things) off-putting. Rather than coming home from the gym happy and refreshed, I found myself more stressed than before I went.

While I realize your target audience is much younger than I am, I did want you to know that you have at least one 60 year old arthritic grandmother in your daily audience.  And I love it.  You all have helped me so much.  

I live in a small town, work as a web programmer so I sit all day at a computer, and have no yoga studio within a 30 mile radius of my home or work.  I was buying videos only to get bored with them or to find them too difficult or unsuitable for me.  I only practice at home with no instructor.

Your classes have been a great blessing to me.  The quality and detail of instruction have helped me learn to tie my movements and my breath.  I had not been able to manage that in the past.  I also feel much more confident in the asanas.

Generally I stick to the beginner or all levels classes and use some of the modifications but I find myself gradually getting a little more flexible as I continue working.  As I said I have degenerative arthritis and bone spurs in my spine and neck, so I'm very stiff in my back and don't even try some positions. I do work on trying to make my spine and neck more flexible without putting myself in danger of injury.

But the amazing thing was that I came away refreshed and clear and light.  It was after that first class that I decided (somewhat not of my own free will) that Yoga was going to be a major part of my life.  The first class was actually in January... and in April I started taking a Yoga Teacher Training Course (200 hrs).  Yoga has changed my life.

It has changed me from being just physically fit to ""Completely Healthy"".  That is where Yoga Today comes in.  Everyday I download a class whether my intention is to do the class or watch and learn so that I can become a better Yoga Instructor.  As both are concerned, Yoga Today is an invaluable asset to not only deepened my own practice but has helped others enhance theirs.  I look forward to watching and participating in your classes everyday and will continue.  

Thank you Yoga Today for helping me reach the goal of a truly healthy lifestyle!! :D

Toby,Zanotti,Patagonia,AZ,United States,tazanotti@mac.com,10/4/2007,Football players doing Yoga Today!,"This school year I was was asked to teach a weight training class to 25 high school students.  I have made your program a Friday tradition.  

I get such a kick out of seeing 25 burly guys (mostly football players) all moving together as they stretch themselves and their concept of strength.  I use a 10' by 10"" DLP projector and the students line up in two rows with all the lights off in the gym.  The darkness makes it safe and this affords me the opportunity to keep tabs on their progress.  

They are all amazed by how much strength and endurance it takes to keep up.  Please keep up the great work.  The more rigorous the better.  By the way, if you all come back down to the southwest this winter, come visit us in Patagonia.  

Thanks...Toby",
Kate,,New Berlin,WI,USA,ksageshaffer@gmail.com,10/6/2007,Staying balanced through med school,"I am came into yoga about a year ago when my boyfriend had a drug overdose.  He then entered drug treatment program, and is now doing much better.  Yoga was my saving grace during that difficult time.  It allowed me to focus on myself and let go of the things I could not control outside of me.  It allowed me to surrender. 

I recently started medical school out in Milwaukee, WI, and with a med school student's budget I could no longer afford to take yoga classes.  Yoga Today is such a blessing in my life, because it helps me to stay balanced in the crazy schedule and course load of medical school.  I am so glad that I have been able to continue my practice of yoga.  I am so thankful for all your hard work.  Please keep all the great classes coming.

I have been practicing yoga for 15 years, ad in my travels around the world, you are three of the best teachers I have practiced with! 

Yoga was with me during both pregnancies, helped me to stay calm and focused during my labor, also helps me to gain strength/ stretch of muscles sore from day to day life. I cannot imagine how I would feel without it.

I am a yoga instructor, middle school teacher, wife and mother of a 2 year old son.  Struggling to keep my classes full in this small mountain town I had to stop teaching.  (Babysitting was paying out more than the classes were bringing in).  

I love and live yoga everyday.  It has been the missing link in my life that I finally found 8 years ago.  Your daily classes bring so much new life to my yoga routine.  You three ladies, and staff have been my free refresher course.  Every class I have taken with you has left me rejuvenated and refreshed.  Not to mention watching my son Noah, try downward dog next to me on the floor, so cute! 

I feel so fulfilled being the student again, not just the teacher.  Not only that, as a wife and working mom it fits in perfectly with my schedule. After grading papers, doing dishes and putting my son to bed, Yoga Today is a great ending to my day.  

Thank you, thank you to everyone on your team.  ",361.jpg
Gary,Jakob,Medford,NJ,USA,garyjakob@yahoo.com,10/19/2007,Since November 2006 I have been doing the practices on an almost daily basis.,"I began practicing yoga about ten years ago when a friend told me about the power yoga tapes by Bryan Kest. I bought all three of his series and began to practice almost every day before work. 

Having been involved in the martial arts since 1963 I was flexible. The yoga practice really appealed to me as I appreciated the balance between strength, stretching and controlled breathing all of which took a lot of concentration. It is difficult for me to not be totally focused and in the present while practicing yoga. While the martial arts gave me discipline I seemed to get more peace of mind from yoga. 

I expanded my yoga practice with tapes and DVD's by Baron Baptiste, David Swensen (primary ashtanga series-one of my favorites), Shiva Rea and others.

One day at a Colgate Univ. swimming meet, Chris Whitman (my son Jeff and Zach Whitman are teammates, friends and room mates) told me about the Yoga Today website. I checked out the program and became ""hooked"". Since November 2006 I have been doing the practices on an almost daily basis. 

I really appreciate the attention to detail in the correct application of the postures given that I did not get from the tapes and DVD's. I also like and appreciate the different approaches to teaching utilized by all three teachers. I especially took to Neesha, partly because she looks and acts so much like my older son's girlfriend (part of the family by then) that I almost felt like I knew her. 

My only criticism was that some of the classes were not as challenging as I would have liked. But Chris told me that early on in the life of the program some of the feedback was that the classes were to difficult. I think that the most recent classes from Jackson Hole are very good. I look forward to the practices on a daily basis with increased enthusiasm. While I still practice my Tai Chi long form, my main interest is my daily practice of yoga.

Thank you for your dedication. Keep up the good work.

As long time basketball player whose body had taken a beating, I realized there had to be something better to heal my old injuries. 

About 3 years ago my then girlfriend, now wife, introduced me to yoga. Initially I began with Bikram, using the heat to help open and ease the pain in my joints and muscles. 

Then a new job moved us to NYC in mid 2006, and with that came a lot of travel. I needed to find a way to make Yoga a part of my day no matter where I was in the country. 

When I came across your site, I immediately knew I had found a true blessing. 

Yoga is so much more than just physical exercise. It is also mental and spiritual and having the chance to build a daily practice into my lifestyle has been a exactly what the doctor ordered.

Thanks Yoga Today and keep up the good work.

Robin,Ruddy,Nashville,TN,USA,banjogirl@bestbuiltsongs.com,10/30/2007,Staying centered while on tour with Rod Stewart,"Hi,

I just want to thank Sarah, Adi and Neesha for helping me continue my practice while I have been traveling around the world this year. The classes are always challenging and I love that they pay so much attention to the tiniest little details. You really help me with remembering the important things like breathing. 

I am touring with Rod Stewart and have been on the road since Jan 2007. I found your site by accident sometime in February 2007. Prior to that I was finding myself hunting down Yoga studios in each new city we went to, and spending money on cabs to take me to a class to keep me centered. Now I can do it each morning in my hotel room and have progressed tremendously, particularly spiritually. In the beginning I did not understand about that amazing fringe benefit. 

Anyway, I have turned all of the people in the band onto Yogatoday.com since they have seen me stretching and breathing once in a while during sound check and they have noticed my calm nature and they are getting curious about it now. 

I love you guys and want you to know you are so appreciated! 

I am writing from Berlin Germany this morning, tomorrow I will be practicing in Vienna Austria, and it goes on and on like that. 

If we ever get to Jackson Hole, I will look you up!

I had been practicing for 3 years while doing a LOT of traveling for work before I found yogatoday.com it was always a pain to find a studio near where I was working. Sometimes the rush of finding and getting to a studio put me under as much stress as what I was trying to escape, which was a little self defeating.

I still travel for work, my work requires constant flying and frequent shift changes.  The strength, focus and energy I can maintain just by making a little space in my hotel room and logging in to yogatoday.com has definitely improved my work performance and reduced my stress.

THANK YOU!

Fatima Sambo,Schoenfelder,Bronx,NY,USA,skylark519@yahoo.com,11/22/2007,Grounded and Inspired,"About 3 weeks ago I had a great scare. I started feeling chest pains and palpitations. I thought I was having a heart attack, but how could I be. I'm 33 years young, pretty healthy, happy, have a great husband, and a good job. So, what was going on? 

Well, during this scary roller coaster ride I found myself being rushed to the hospital twice in two days. I was told that my EKG was ""excellent"" the first time I went to the ER. That was all. I was sent home and told to call my primary doctor. So, I went home and waited for something to happen. 

The next day, I was on the subway on my way to work and started to feel overwhelmed and my heart was beating so fast and hard I thought I was going to pass out. Again I went to the ER and again the doctor said my EKG looked good, however he did say to see a cardiologist that it may be an arrhythmia. Well, to make a long story short, my cardiologist did an electrocardiogram and saw that I have Mitral valve prolapse. 

He suggested that I take up some yoga. I started looking into yoga centers in the city, but not really finding what I wanted. I've taken yoga in school and at the local Y before and found that the students were too busy competing with each other. 

Through my research on internet, I found Yoga Today and I'm glad to say that this is my first week and already I feel grounded and inspired. I've been passing on the website to everyone I know.

Thank you for the daily classes, but, probably more importantly, for the company, as when I'm practicing the postures, I feel I'm part of the Yoga Today community. 

Only one of my friends practices yoga, so I often feel I need some motivation and I get it as soon as I watch the daily classes. It reverberates deep within me, with such power.

I have been practicing with yogatoday for nearly a year now and I can't begin to thank the entire team that makes it happen enough. 

My story is similar to several of my fellow online practitioners in that I am living overseas in an area where yoga classes aren't available. Although I continued my home practice, I came to realize that it had slowly become a reflection of the isolation that I often felt as an ex-pat. I sorely missed being a part of a yoga community and yogatoday has brought that back to me in spades. 

My practice now is more fulfilling and more fun than it has ever been. Physically, I am getting stronger, little by little. More importantly, I have gained invaluable and concrete tools for dealing with the chronic insomnia that I have experienced for 15 years. Yogatoday has helped me enormously in this regard. As someone who has tried everything for insomnia, I can't thank you enough for Sarah's class on the subject that you ran many months ago. It would be wonderful if you could cover that again for those that missed it the first time around! 

I appreciate so much each of the three amazing teachers and the unique perspectives that they have to offer. Adi has clarified things that I had never understood, Neesha has made me laugh on days when I thought it impossible and Sarah has inspired me to do things that I didn't think I was capable of. Thank you as well, Kim, for working so hard to make this accessible to everyone. The good intentions of all involved really do make it around the world to your viewers!

Namaste,

Being away from my husband, two dogs, and home is tough both mentally and physically. Since it's hard to fit in a regular yoga class, my yoga instructor at home recommended this site because of the phenomenal backdrops, informative & easy-to-follow instructors, and varied classes--I get bored easily...

Even after long days working and flying, I really look forward to my choice of classes depending on my mood/energy level. I've found I'm less stressed during the week and less wound up when I get back home. I'm also not as stiff when I attend my weekly in-person class back home. Incidentally, I've also been introduced to some new postures that I think will be great for the upcoming ski season!

I was looking for something to help me more on a mental and emotional level, having suffered from depression, anxiety and just plain fear for most of my life (I'm 28).

Your classes are something I look forward to every day and although I can find them hard (I'm not terribly flexible and get frustrated by my lack of strength), I get such a sense of private achievement from them. This is something which is just for me and which is more than just exercise.

When I'm on my 'sticky mat' (I love that name) I feel safe and calm, and connected with the instructors. I try to remember the things I've learned in class throughout the day.

As an added bonus, my flexibility is improving slowly and every time I manage to do a pose I've not achieved before I feel a real joy. I've been suffering from nerve pain through repetitive strain injury for nine months, but I feel my daily yoga class has been a key factor in reducing that pain and the strength in my arm has improved too.

As someone who doesn't naturally seek to 'belong', it's nice to feel part of something, and enjoy that feeling.

Every day is a challenge, but for at least an hour each day I simply am.

I like the idea of dedicating my efforts of the classes to a special someone, and I also like how you talk about being good and doing good for others. I believe my yoga training helps me in becoming more passionate and also more patient. Hence, physical yoga classes make my everyday life easier. The idea of sharing the classes with other yogis around the world just adds to the feeling of being united.

I am diligent about finding time for yoga on a daily basis.  It may only be a short meditation, a few sun salutations or an intentional kind word.  What's nice about Yoga Today is it offers another opportunity to ""receive"" yoga into my life when I need it.  The practices are positive, safe and experiential.

I instantly fell in love, and subsequently spent the last 8 years dabbling in Yoga. Classes here and there, a sporadic home practice. Then, my husband and I moved to Taiwan. We moved to a very rural area of the island, I found no Yoga classes, and my confidence wained in creating a home practice. 

My mom was mailing me copy's of Yoga Journal, and it was there that I saw an advert for Free Yoga Classes online. I've never looked back since.

Yoga Today has brought Yoga back into my life! For a year now I have had consistent teachings from Adi, Neesha and Sarah. My practice has been transformed, my body is strong and supple, and the positive effects of a Yoga practice have permeated through every area of my life.

You guys offer online classes of the same caliber as some of the best yoga studios in San Francisco. 

I love the variety of classes, and the three teachers are awesome. I always pick Adi's classes when I feel like I have the energy to work hard and be challenged, and Neesha's classes when I have crazy aches and soreness from stress and sedentary work that needs to be worked out, and then Sarah's classes when I need something soothing and cleansing. 

Seriously, you guys are the best. I love classes that invite my body to engage in the opposite directions than those which I am in all day (i.e. backbending, twists, and all hip, shoulder, neck openers)... I love it all.

One of the things that has been missing throughout my learning process is much of the philosophy and the things which drew me to yoga in the first place such as awareness, finding bliss, feeling the breath.  I just completed the Ashtanga Primary Series video and last weekend I did Neesha's bliss practice.  

Thanks to you, after years of sporadic practice with limited benefit, I am finding my breath, becoming aware of the places I hold tension, and practicing to find the joy of yoga.  

Many instructors fail to remind the students of these integral lessons while focusing on body position, alignment, and movement.  I appreciate sincerely the opportunity you have given me to find joy and peace in my practice.

Please continue to emphasize these important lessons.

I would like to offer my utmost gratitude to everyone that works on giving us Yoga Today programming. You have truly affected my life. I have been a twice a week yoga practitioner for many years and am thankful I have a wonderful teacher. 

Since June of last year, I have been off work with a severe back problem, so severe at first that I could not walk, or do yoga. I spent the first 4 weeks in bed. I tried everything, chiropractic, traction, physical therapy, etc., all with minimal results. 

I fortunately remembered hearing or reading something about Yoga Today, and immediately began practicing with you everyday. Soon, I was making progress that even my Physical Therapist was surprised to see! I have been able to return to many activities that I enjoy. And although I still have many obstacles ahead of me, I am better equipped, mentally, physically and spiritually.

So, Thank you, each and every one of you that help give us Yoga Today! You have given me my life back, and then some, as my mental and spiritual being has been brought forth with peace I never thought possible.

Namaste!

I am a, what I like to call, 'freelance' yoga instructor in the Columbia Gorge in Western Oregon. I have taught in many places while traveling, such as the beach in Mexico, to skydivers near Mexico City, and to kayakers in Ecuador. 

I love teaching outside, in unconventional settings, helping people discover the benefits of yoga, and apply them to the sports they love and practice, and eventually, to other aspects of their lives.

Yoga Today appeals to me as an instructor for several reasons. First, the outdoor setting of your studio is right up my alley. It is a wonderful reminder of summer days that are sure to come again. Second, your instructors are top-notch: thorough, knowledgeable, and approachable. Lastly, it allows me to practice without having to plan my own class. Not having to drive to town and still getting a great and challenging class is really quite perfect.

I look forward to more of your classes. I am currently watching Sarah's Sciatic Nerve Care class, and am very impressed with both the content and methodology.

Emily,hilliard,Burlington,VT,,emilyhilliard@gmail.com,2/13/2008,Blogging to share the greatness of Yoga Today!!,"I love yoga. But I can't afford to go to a class as often as I'd like. I recently discovered this great site, Yoga Today, which offers a new 1 hr. class each day, as well the past week's worth of classes, so you can chose the class to suit your mood. There are classes for all skills levels, astanga flow, healing and classes to target certain activities or parts of the body.

It has totally increased my yoga intake, to where I am yoga-ing at least 3-4 times a week, and has definitely improved my practice, strength, and overall state-of-being.

It's become a great little routine after work and on weekend mornings. I've got a nice set up in my living room with my mat, a homemade yoga mix (way better than the cheesy 'yoga music' crap they play in most yoga classes), or listen to my friend's classical radio show 'Morning Woodwinds' on Sunday morns, burn some cedar incense, and let it flow--all in the privacy of my own home.

Of course, it's important to support your local yoga instructor, get posture guidance, and practice with other other living beings, but when you can't, give Yoga Today a try.

Namaste...

Without Yoga Today, it was hard to motivate myself to do the same exercises every time at home. I find it much more stimulating to practise yoga in a class with a teacher.

Many times I’ve thought in sending an e-mail but I didn’t because of this difficulty with the language. I’m an Argentine woman of 48 years old, living in Uruguay, I’m marriage and we’ve got three teenagers, I’m a biologist but at this moment I’m working at home where I always have lots of thins to do, especially now because we are in a new life project that takes plenty of time.

I found you in iTunes last year, and I discovered yoga. I’m really happy because it’s not only very pleasant, but also healthy. I really like the possibility of working with the respiration, balance, strength and flexibility in a conscious way. I want to thank Adi, Neesha and Sarah who are very good teachers: clear and dynamic.

I live 10 Km from Piriapolis a seaside holiday town, very beautiful but with not much activities. Moreover it’s not easy for me to go out to take a class, so the possibility of doing it at home is a perfect one. Each week I’m trying to reserve time to do three or four classes. Nevertheless in the future I would like to take some classes to have a control on what I’m doing. 

My Internet connection is slow to see the videos so I do the classes with the audio-only stream version. It is challenge following the instructions in English but sometimes I get lost, especially in some classes where there are some new poses.  Photos with a short description of not habitual poses could be a good idea.

I miss seeing you and the marvelous surrounding; this is really a plus in your classes. Fortunately I began some months ago and all I learned is helping me to follow the class.

Next year we will move to a livestock farm, I suppose the connection could be slower there, but I had a collection of the old ones.  I think perhaps it won’t be possible for me to pay for the downloads, prices in dollars are expensive for Latin-Americans but perhaps I can get some downloads once in a while.

I went to a fysiotherapist, because several months after an accident where I fell on my knee, I still had trouble with it. That treatment didn't help at all :-(

I  haven't attended much of leader led yoga classes, instead I do the exercises I can remember and think (and experience) that less is better than nothing. The rounds of sun salutations and tree balance exercise have become important in my life. 

Having become parent to my second child, this seems even more important, and I just found a great session that I can partly do as an unwinding break at work which is wonderful. Reducing my inner tempo makes me function so much better.

I would consider myself very active person. SO this was extremely debilitating for me.  I had severe sciatica in my right leg. To the point that if I was out walking my leg would feel as if it was on fire. A couple of times going shopping, I felt as if I would have to crawl out of the grocery store because the pain was so intense in my leg.  Driving was the worse or sitting for any length of time.

I did the typical orthopedic, pain management ( 3 Steroid shots in the back) which gave temporary relief, physical therapy, chiropractor and finally talked to a Spine specialist who recommended a microdisectomy. 

Upon the recommendation of a friend, I started a yoga classes and palates. Initially for me to even arch my back slightly was painful. However, I really started to see the benefits of yoga. I became more flexible and my body was starting to have balance. My yoga workouts I felt were much better than weight lifting. Now about a year and a half later, i'm actually able to do a back bend. 

I would say that the pain in my back is almost gone. There are the odd times when i might feel a slight pain in my leg but nothing that compares how it use to be. In fact I was scheduled for surgery, two days before the surgeon recommended to hold off since my condition had greatly improved. I attribute my recovery to yoga. 

I train 4 days a week including 2 power yoga classes. I would say that I'm probably stronger and more flexible now that I'm in my 40's than I have ever been. If you have back pain I would highly recommend yoga. Yoga is the best workout you can have. ",

Rene,,Snohomish,WA,USA,rholt@riotofdaisies.com,7/10/2008,Yoga Today makes a difference in the quality of my life every day.,"I am so grateful for Yoga Today.  

After my first surgery for endometriosis four years ago, I was told to do yoga to help with recovery.  Unfortunately, I live in an area where there isn't easy access to a studio and the few around don't have classes at times that coincide with my work schedule.  

Until I found Yoga Today, the only access to yoga I had was DVDs.  Most of them focus on physical fitness but ignore the mental, spiritual, and other healthful benefits.  Additionally, while they showed basic postures they never explained the theory behind them.

Since finding Yoga Today, I've been able to move my practice beyond mere strength and flexibility to something deeper.  Because you offer classes for various levels, I'm able to learn and progress instead of doing the same routine for months at a time.  

I've also seen more spiritual benefits that have helped reduced my stress and deepened my enjoyment of my practice.  Yoga has helped me live a more normal life despite the difficulties of having an incurable disease like endometriosis.

Yoga Today has been a great blessing for me.  I now have access to knowledgeable instructors of yoga who can guide me through a real practice.  I also feel like I'm now capable of working with my body to overcome endometriosis rather than feeling like it's against me.  

Thank you so much for giving this to people everywhere.  It makes a difference in the quality of my life every day.",

I knew I had to do something with my body in this journey, but I could not find a way that feels right. Then reading a book, I met with yoga -real yoga- different from the popular appearance of it. And with yoga today I had the chance to try it.  

I'm realizing surprisingly my body has some answers. With the right pose, with the right breath; you get more than you give to it and there starts a real communication with the body. (A little experience of yoga every day brings you to a level, I feel like yoga is the right way to treat our body.)   

I'm sure there are several ways to expand what we know about our body, about our physical being; but I chose to trust to yoga because it's an old doctrine- maybe the oldest- and with you, I easily reached it.

Rachel,Gilmore,Brooklyn,NY,,rachelgilmore@gmail.com,7/23/2008,The expertly taught classes and soothing meditation truly eased my stress and fatigue on the road.,"I've been practicing with the three of you for almost two years now.

Obviously I couldn't take a regular yoga class when I didn't stay in the same place longer than a few days!

Maria,Orlando,Lowell,MA,,laftilucry@yahoo.com,7/24/2008,Thank you Yoga today for offering all of us the freedom to live our lives mindfully and peacefully.,"I was introduced to yoga again over 3 yrs. ago. I had tried it in the past but convinced myself that it wasn't for me, I enjoyed other activities such as strength training, kickboxing, etc. and I had a difficult time slowing down for yoga. 

Well, 3 yrs. ago when I was introduced to it again, I discovered that the challenge of slowing down and breathing became more appealing to me, because it was and continues to be the greatest challenge in my practice.  

I came across Yogatoday's website in a magazine and have been hooked ever since. I have also told everyone I know about it, to a point that I sometimes feel as though I am preaching about the great benefits I have discovered through yoga. 

Not only have I been able to slow down, stay more present in the moment and relax, I have also become more toned and long. My confidence and self assurance is balanced and yoga has helped me deal and move beyond some difficult issues that I have been afraid to address in the past. I continuously say that yoga has been my therapy.

Moreover, yoga has also impacted what I put into my body, as I find my body craving more healthy choices. I am on the verge of quitting smoking, after smoking for over 10yrs. and I intend to use yoga as a calming and strengthening method. 

I am a firm believer in the mind, body and soul connection and I didn't recognize just how much I was until I consistently began practicing yoga.  If it weren't for yoga today, I would not have been able to explore my practice more fully, as classes can become expensive and monotonous.  

Thank you Yoga today for offering all of us the freedom to live our lives mindfully and peacefully.

I am a mother of two boys, (5 and 3) and Yoga Today always has a positive impact on my physical energy, and more importantly, it gives me more patience and presence with my children.  I have tried yoga before, but never could consistently practice due to cost or scheduling or both.  Now I have the freedom to practice whenever I want. 

I just found out we are expecting our third child, and today I did my first Yoga Today while pregnant.  I was a little worried that it might be too much, (my first trimester has always been very difficult) but with Sarah's first time beginner's class, I was able too keep up and never felt over-extended.  (And I hadn't actually done a yoga session in a while).  

I was wondering if you could add a class or two for pregnant women, especially in the later stages when our bodies get unwieldy!  I know this is a huge request, but it can't hurt to ask:) I will try to keep up as best I can otherwise!! I know it will make a positive difference in my pregnancy.

Thank you again for all the hard work and especially to the three wonderful teachers.  They all really are quite wonderful. You are truly spreading love and unity though your teaching.

I remembered the busy schedule of a Yoga retreat I have been to this February: morning meditation, followed by morning asanas, healthy lunch, restorative poses and evening meditation. 

After only two days I feel so relaxed and grateful for this ""emergency kit"". Yoga today inspires my morning asanas, and keeps me motivated as it is hard to practice on your own.

The problem is that I cannot afford to take any actual classes, and you can only get so far with books and videos. 

Losing motivation is easy when you have to expend more effort finding the the workout than doing it.  I make it a goal to work out every day, or close to it, to stay fit and to make it a habit for life, but I rely strictly on things I can do in my home without any equipment.  

Because of this I've been doing pilates everyday for the past few months, but the routines are beginning to grow dull, even if I switch up the order, because all the moves are the same.  So I began to search online for something new.

Though I wasn't even 20 years old when those accidents happened, I could barely go through the day without back pain (stemming from my hips).  Some days would be more severe than others. 

By age 21 I was fed up with being unable to play sports that I had previously enjoyed and was starting to gain weight as a result.  I decided to go to a massage therapist who stressed the importance of stretching my injured areas that had been covered in scar tissue for the last five years of my life.  

I had always been very flexible, having practiced karate and figure skating as a child, and was shocked to find muscles in my body that could barely be moved. 

I had previously flirted with yoga for fun, but was now turning to it much more seriously as a way to stretch all of those obscure muscles that so badly needed to be stretched. 

Without the time or money to go to a yoga class, I was OVERJOYED to hear about Yoga Today in a random magazine. I am so thankful for the work that you do.  I started watching Yoga Today once a day and now that I am working (something I wasn't able to do before because of my injuries) I try to fit it in every couple of days.  I am excited to go back to my massage therapist so that he can see the change that has happened in just one month!

Please do not give up this service. We are so appreciative, and would love to know anything we can do to keep you running. I figured at least, I'll start clicking your sponsor ads and I will look forward to more great yoga.

While he is there I will be attending school at the California Institute of the Arts to get my Masters in dance choreography/ performance. I've been doing so many things to get myself and my new place prepared for what is to come that I haven't been paying any attention to my body. Which is not good since I'm a dancer/ choreographer. I have also started to feel more sadness since my husband is away. It really is hard being a wife of a military man.

Anyway, I found this website and thought that getting back into yoga would really help me calm everything in my life. As well as energize me to get out more and get my body and all my awareness ready to go back to school.

Since then it has been so hard to find a decent class that is at the right level, and that doesn't cost a ton.  

After 6 months of working 14 hour days, my back started having major issues. I went to physio weekly, and didn't have time to go to the gym (it was either gym or dinner/sleep) and my health went down significantly. Then I became pregnant and the back issues only got worse.  

After the baby my back problems continued for months (still doing physio) until I found YogaToday.  Since I have been able to do routines whenever and for however long I am able (before the baby wakes, for example), I haven't had to go back to physio since!!  And even though my kid only gets heavier each month, my back is stronger than ever.  Not only this, but I love how I am more toned now than when I was lifting weights and going to the gym regularly! 

I LOVE YogaToday and always recommend it to my friends. It's a great gift to have such wonderful classes so accessible.

Enthralled with yoga's possibilities, I jumped in full force and within a month I was practicing every day. Almost every one of these days was spent at the studio because I so greatly appreciated the voice of my teachers as I worked my hardests reminding me where my gaze should be, where my shoulders should direct, and when to relax parts of my body that are not involved in a pose. 

Your online classes have allowed me to continue such a practice without the full financial burden of an unlimited membership at my studio (which I can no longer afford). All teachers say everything that needs to be said in just the right time, more often then not I feel as if they could be right behind me. Also, it has been highly supplemental to my regular practice in that I've learned new styles and poses my teachers don't teach (such as Kundalini, 5 Tibetan Rites, some backbends)

I would also like to commend the instructors. I have taken many Yoga classes and I find that Adi, Neesha, and Sarah are all so wonderful - and different enough that there is variety. There also seems to be some congruency with poses throughout the classes, which helps as each teacher explains poses in a slightly different manner- it's perfect.

I have been practicing with Yoga Today almost daily, and not only has my practice become more advanced, but it is truly one of the most enjoyable parts of my day. I love the scenery as well! (even though it makes me a little homesick :)

I'm a very active person and recently I decided to start doing yoga because it would help me with my grappling competitions and stress. So I tried to find some classes, but none of them fit what I was looking for, so i went and got a dvd. 

The very next day my Sensei told me about this site. I tried it out and unfortunately was interrupted a bit so I didn't get the full scale of how it really worked. I wanted to do it in the mornings, before work. To do that I had to get up an hour early and that worried me a bit because I thought after I would be tired all day. Well, I finally bucked up and did it on a wed. morning and that was the first day in a very long time I didn't feel like smashing my face into the floor and knocking off some z's in the middle of my day. It was AMAZING!! 

The instructors were through-o(:P) and I felt like I had accomplished something great because HOLY COW YOGA IS HARD! But it is so rewarding. 

Ive been doing it every morning, the hour always seems to fly by and before I was doing yoga I would be cracking my neck all the time...eww I know..:(. But I had to because it was so tight. Now ...I don't have any of that tightness and being an athlete and hairstylist I work my upper body very hard and I'm so impressed and pleased with what you have helped me to accomplish.

John,v.,Jackson Hole,WY,,bonikerbo@yahoo.com,2/11/2009,mad props,"Last Saturday while riding the gondola here in Jackson Hole, I learned of this site from a really cute girl w/an intriguing vibe in her eyes. She was with her mom who was visiting from upstate NY; having grown up skiing in the Catskills, and knowing the benefits of yoga to skiers over 30... I wanted to say so, and she seemed proud to be involved in producing ""yoga today"" but someone else was making jokes about their dog doing 4 poses every morning. So I remained quiet, but let me revisit by saying ""right on GIRL-mad props""

With this has come an incredible sense of freedom from time/financial constraints, and enormous benefit, for both body and mind and the soul that lives within these four walls. (and freedom of worry that I am not going to be strong enough for my next dance contract)

I thank all at Yogatoday for this amazing opportunity. The chance to feel a part of the energy of the mountains and forests. The escape from the noise and the hustle, and for the daily reminder that this world is bigger than me, which gives me the strength to keep going in the face of daily adversity, and the clear sight to see that the challenges are really doors closing for a while, making me look into another room that I have never been in, to see what I can learn.

Just wanted to say ~ Every day I look forward to my time with you.  All three of you have individually helped me expand my understanding and my practice. You have made me larger and stronger and more peacefully alive and I GREATLY appreciate the effort you've put in here at this site. 

Thank you, too, to all technicians and editors and everyone behind the scenes. The classes are so beautifully presented that I send people to the site just to see see how nice it all is. I feel like you care about what we're seeing and that's really great. Thank you. 

Yoginis - all your instructions are so clear that I will go a minute without watching the screen, just following your voices, and I'll look up and find that I'm still with you. (And, I love Neesha's way saying of things like ""Good! That's a different variation!"":))

I could go on and on, but basically, from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much.

(Adi - you were the teacher of the first video I saw - and ever since then, I have loved and looked forward to your classes. You could say that you hooked me, and I have appreciated all your teachings. I have opened myself up to my ""solidity"" a lot, and the powerful arrangement of my energy, since learning from you. It has expanded me and helped my presence in my inverted and one-legged poses - which has changed, uh, everything. (And also grace.) Thank you.:) 

(Sarah! I have seen two of your videos now - the first was the 7Tibetan Rituals (?), and I remember thinking ""What a strong woman!"" You are so clearly present in your body when you practice that it's a great thing to see. It's like you have an innate faith that we can do this. That we ALL can do this. Like you are feeling and expressing the immediate connection between action and thought - and it is so powerful. I love it. You are inspiring and energize my life. Thank you for sharing your path. 

Neeshaaa! Thank you for being my first introduction to Anusara yoga.  It's a wave of deep knowledge and I'm still totally awash in it. It has changed my practice deeply and given me strength in areas I really needed. I DEEPLY cherish your classes and expression and I learn from you every time. Thank you so so so so much .  

So, anyways, thank you all again. I've studied yoga on and off (mostly off) for about 6 years. Something has changed in my spirit lately and yoga has become a lot more important ~ so I'm learning a lot right now - about all of it - and about how yoga fits into peace and a clearer stronger existence ~ ~ and you guys are all part of that ... ~ so thank you for the energy you put here.

I enjoy your classes so much that I am hooked on logging on and joining you in all your varied practices. I enjoy doing a different class each day and learning new postures with you. 

Yoga today has become a natural part of my life rather than the exercise routine that I tried to maintain before - which seemed more of a chore.

Thank you so much. I think it is amazing that you offer this to an international audience and touch so many lives.

Namaste

LS,,Vancouver,,Canada,Leyna_baby@hotmail.com,3/30/2009,you are fulfilling the intention that you so lovingly set forth.,"I found Yoga Today during a really restless night, I was going through a difficult time, I felt like my entire life was just not working. Something said in one of the classes really stuck with me that night, and has kept me coming back. 

I remember the essence of the statement was that you can begin to cultivate your true self on the mat, and eventually, it will carry over to off the mat. When I heard it I could only hope it was true, and now after a few months I am assured that it absolutely is true. 

I try to do a class four times a week. Thanks to the teachings in the classes I can forgive myself if I don't! I love any of the classes that focus on enhancing spiritual qualities through yoga practice. 

My deepest gratitude goes to all of you ladies at Yoga Today for being so generous with your knowlege and teaching!

I just want to say a massive thank you for providing this free. I've done two classes now and know this is going to change my life. 

I've wanted to restart yoga training for a long time now but haven't been able to afford going to a class. I doubt it would be as good as these are anyway, the teachers are so inspirational and I love the spirituality they bring to each lesson.

With your classes I not only get a beautiful class for free everyday but I also get to escape the winter by listening to the birds chirp or the leaves blowing in the background as I practice my daily yoga with Adi, Neesha and Sarah. I greatly thank you all for making this such an available class to so many.

Claire,Foster,Portland,OR,,claire.rudy.foster@gmail.com,4/3/2009,"I feel proud of my body's ability to change, and thank Yoga Today for giving me the tools to do it!","I have been practicing yoga since I was 16. (Almost 10 years.) I started in Hatha Yoga, and I loved the deep focus and relaxation I got from the poses. I also enjoyed the sense of lightness and humor the instructor shared with the class. 

Since that very early experience, I have always turned to yoga to ground me. I studied dance intensively in college, and always incorporated a strong yoga component in my choreography. When I needed inspiration, I knew I could draw on yoga's knowledge of body mechanics and strength.

I continued to practice yoga, mainly Hatha, through my pregnancy. I used yoga breathing during my labor, and opened my hips using some of the squatting poses. I was able to have a completely natural, drug-free birth, and I attribute it largely to my ability to focus my mind -- another thing learned on the yoga mat.

Finding Yoga Today was a real blessing to me. In the very early morning, after feeding my baby and putting him back to bed, I love to follow one of Adi's Ashtanga sequences. She has the same lightness and joy that I once experienced with my first yoga teacher. It's a great way to wake up, and after an hour of muscle work I feel strong and prepared to face my day. 

Additionally, my dancer's body is returning. I had gained 50 pounds during my pregnancy and lost a lot of muscle tone, but using yoga has gotten me back into shape in less than a month. I feel proud of my body's ability to change, and I thank Yoga Today for giving me the tools to do it!

Love,

I find it crucial to literally have the experience of strengthening physical and spiritual change in my whole being in whatever I do. 

Every time I go to your website and do yoga with you, later on there is a delicate yet profound shift in the way I feel. I especially like Neesha's sessions because of how much they cover, yet, in a peaceful and steady way; different levels of difficulty are included in every class which I think is great. 

You help me to gently step out of my comfort zone and accomplish more than I could envision for myself. I am learning all the creative postures that I didn't even know they existed. 

Thank you for your work and being;)

In each class there is a nice balance between the philosophical and physiological aspects of the yoga tradition. 

I'm filled with immense gratitude that YogaToday is available to draw inspiration from. Adi, Neesha and Sarah guide fabulously balanced classes that I learn something new from everyday.

I have always been involved in athletics- basketball, track, cross country, and dance- but have just begun practicing yoga a couple of months ago.

I planned to join the classes at the University's Wellness Center, but had trouble affording their rates. So, I began trying different podcasts and web videos. I want you to know, after being overwhelmed and trying MANY different sources, YogaToday has been the best. 

I am always eager to see what the new video will bring! All 3 instructors on the site are wonderful.

Danielle,Murphy,Boise,ID,,miss.d.murphy@gmail.com,4/18/2009,You have helped me to obtain peace in my body as well as settling my mind daily. I am hooked.,"Hello,

I recently moved to the US from the UK. I have suffered from lower back pain for years and this coupled with being in a new country pushed me to try something new. I had previously tried yoga when I was 14 but couldn't take to it. I had a feeling yoga could help my back so I searched the internet for a taster before I enrolled in classes. 

I started doing yoga from yogatoday about 2 months ago I am hooked. So much so that I never made it to a yoga class. My back pain has gone and I am able to walk a mile without feeling the need to bend over and touch my toes.

I love the setting of yogatoday and I love the instructors, how fun they are and how good they are at explaining poses. I feel like I can safely adjust myself accordingly even although they aren't with me.

I especially enjoy when the instructor explains what a pose is for. For example open the heart for compassion, reach back in cobra as a shedding of old ways of being. I find this information gives me more strength and purpose in my poses.

Thank you for the gift of yoga today. You have helped me to obtain peace in my body as well as settling my mind daily.",
