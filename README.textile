h2. Installation

For development, you'll need to install the gems for each environment:

<code>
  rake gems:install && rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=test && rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=cucumber
</code>

Then create a database.yml for development and test environments. Once you have them, run these rake tasks:

<pre><code>
rake db:create
rake db:schema:load
rake db:bootstrap
</code></pre>

That should give you a sample set of data to get up and running

h2. Testing

Pretty much all of the rspec, unit, functional, and integration tests aren't working.

Cucumber tests on the other hand are up to date and passing. If you develop new features,
consider adding them using cucumber. Everyone will be happy that you did.

To run cucumber tests:

<pre><code>rake cucumber</code></pre>

h2. Deploying apps

To deploy to the staging server:

  <pre><code>cap staging deloy</code></pre>

To deploy to the production server:

  <pre><code>cap production deloy</code></pre>
